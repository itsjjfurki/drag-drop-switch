== Description ==

### Disable drag-drop for meta boxes

This plugin adds a toggle switch under "Screen Options" to disable or enable drag-and-drop functionality for meta boxes if Classic Editor plugin is installed and active.

### Why use this plugin?

If you’re using the Classic Editor plugin to manage your WordPress posts and pages, you may have encountered an annoying issue: while scrolling through the post editing page on touch screen devices, the meta boxes on the screen often move unintentionally due to their drag-and-drop functionality. This can disrupt your workflow and create unnecessary frustration.

This plugin solves that problem by disabling the drag-and-drop feature for meta boxes on the post editing page when the Classic Editor is active.
